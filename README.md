# WebHut Overview 

A Solo project to practice and improve my knowledge of web application. 

I Utilized Spring Boot Actuator, Maven, Eclipse IDE, and Java to build a Web Application and named it **WebHut**. 

Using WebHut, you can posts content on a JSP file.

WebHut lunches a HTML file that has a link to a JSP file where the contents are stored.
